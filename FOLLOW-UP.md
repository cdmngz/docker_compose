# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

- React with Typescript template: To have all the initial folder structure with the basic TS files
- Tailwind: An easy way to create nice and responsive styles
- Lint: To clean/format the code

### Q) What's the command to start the frontend application locally?

- short: npm start
- long: npx react-scripts start

### Q) What libraries did you add to the backend? What are they used for?

- Express: To handler API Rest petitions with easier code in nodeJs
- Typescript: For create/compile TS files
- Types/express: By default we don't have the type structure of Express when we use import in the app, so there is a community of good people that prepare the ExpressType for us

### Q) What's the command to start the backend application locally?

- short: npm start
- long: node build/index.js

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

- A dark mode toggle button and a search input in the front

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

- The crypto images in the front, makes me feel like I want to eat candies, and that feels good

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

- Understand the order books JSON... puff, the idea is clear, but the ASC/DESC order, uff

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

- I think it was really good, very punctual and practical. I was watching the BTC order books when I was developing, like wtf, from almost 34 to 30 in hours... that was crazy. Well, thanks for your time üëçüèº
